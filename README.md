## Motivation
This project is an interview assignment, so the main goal, obviously, was to fulfill the requirements. However, I also decided to have some fun with it, and this is why I decided to implement a terminal-gui interface with mouse support.


## Run
In order to run the project, you must have [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
installed on your machine.
