# Super Farmer

## Description
The main idea behind this fun, little project is to create an implementation of Super Farmer board game.  
The rules and guidelines are available here:

## Motivation
This project is an interview assignment, so the main goal, obviously, was to fulfill the requirements. However, I also decided to have some fun with it, and this is why I decided to implement a terminal-gui interface with mouse support.


## Run
In order to run the project, you must have [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
installed on your machine.  
Then simply navigate to the `/SuperFarmer` directory and run the project
```bash
